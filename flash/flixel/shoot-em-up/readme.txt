Uses art from SpriteLib by WidgetWorx.  Big ups for that.

Also thanks to the people who made Allegro Sprite Editor / ASE.


Build Instructions
---

Requires Flixel to build, copy as a "org" directory under this one.

Build with mxmlc:

	mxmlc ShootGame.as

This should create a file called ShootGame.swf.
