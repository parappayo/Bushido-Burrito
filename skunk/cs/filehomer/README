Please Note!

If you're looking for some good file directory search software, you probably don't want this.  You are free to refer to and modify my code for your own purposes as per LICENSE, of course.

Windows users should check out the following projects instead of using mine:

- "Everything" by Void Tools
- "Agent Ransack" by Mythic Soft

Motivation:

I work on a project that has some odd four thousand source files. A major productivity hurdle for me is to be able to find any given source file quickly from a partial file name. Windows doesn't provide a good search tool for this, however Visual Assist X by Whole Tomato software adds a feature to Visual Studio which is very much like what I want. I decided to write my own project loosely based off of their interface so that I can use my own editor (gVim) without having to rely on Visual Studio. I am targeting Mono so that the project can be used in Linux and Mac OS X environments as well as Windows.

Build Instructions:

Mono version: "make clean" and "make all".

Windows version: use filehomer.sln.  This project file was created with SharpDevelop, but you can also build it with Visual Studio Express.

SharpDevelop web site: http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SD/

For Linux users there is also MonoDevelop.
