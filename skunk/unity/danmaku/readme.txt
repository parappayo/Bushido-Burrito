Danmaku Sandbox Testing

Just some modules, getting a feel for how to put together danmaku patterns in a flexible, Unity-centric way.

TODO:
- switch to using fixed point physics, need bullet behaviours to be more deterministic
- component active / deactivate timeline script
- collision detection system (trigger spheres)
- level loading and unloading
