Danmaku Sandbox Testing

Just some modules, getting a feel for how to put together danmaku patterns in a flexible, Unity-centric way.

TODO:
- switch to using FixedUpdate, need bullet behaviours to be more deterministic
- need a naming sceme to distinguish motion behaviours from trigger behaviours
- component active / deactivate timeline script
- collision detection system
- level loading and unloading
