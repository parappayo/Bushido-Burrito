Danmaku Sandbox Testing

Just some modules, getting a feel for how to put together danmaku patterns in a flexible, Unity-centric way.

TODO:
- how to do spread patterns? need some kind of composite multi-emitter?
	- multi-spawn in waves with a velocity function time offset setting
- bullets should fade in with an alpha tween that resets on spawn
- switch to using fixed point physics, need bullet behaviours to be more deterministic
- collision detection system (trigger spheres)
- obstacle / target component that absorbs bullets
- player movement, hit detection
- component active / deactivate timeline script
- level loading and unloading
