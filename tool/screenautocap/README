ScreenAutocap Documentation
---------------------------

How to Use It:

- Windowed version:  Launch it, and so long as it is open (including while it
  is minimized), pressing PrntScr (or whatever variation on Print Screen your
  keyboard has) will cause a desktop screen capture to be written to a file.

- Command Line version: A screen capture is written to file every time the
  command line version is launched.  An output directory may be specified
  as an optional parameter.

- All files are written to the current working directory of the program.
  The command line version offers an option to specify an output directory.

- Output files are in PNG format: http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/

- Ouput files are named screen.png, screen0.png, screen1.png, etc.
  Existing files will not be overwritten.

Ideas for Future Development:

- Allow WinForms version to minimize to the system tray
- WinForms version ability to output to a specified directory
